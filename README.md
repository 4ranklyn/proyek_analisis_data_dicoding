# Bike Sharing Data Analysis Project

## Introduction

This project analyzes bike sharing data to understand user behavior and identify factors influencing bike usage. We aim to answer key business questions related to user trends, seasonal patterns, and environmental factors.

## Data

The project utilizes two datasets:

- `hour.csv`: Contains hourly bike sharing data.
- `day.csv`: Contains daily bike sharing data.

## Questions

The project seeks to answer the following questions:

1. **How many users used the service during the 2 years?**
2. **In which month did the service have the most users? Why?**
3. **At what hour is peak service usage? Why?**
4. **Does a holiday affect the number of users?**

## Methodology

The project involves the following steps:

1. **Data Wrangling:** Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis. This involves handling missing values, converting data types, and transforming variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Exploring the data to identify patterns, relationships, and potential insights. This involves descriptive statistics, correlation analysis, and visualization.
3. **Visualization and Explanatory Analysis:** Visualizing the data to gain deeper insights and answer the research questions.

## Results

The analysis reveals:

- **Question 1:** Total user count during the 2 years, distribution of casual vs registered users.
- **Question 2:** The month with the highest user count and possible contributing factors (weather, season).
- **Question 3:** The peak hour of user count and the potential reasons behind it (e.g., commuting patterns).
- **Question 4:** The impact of holidays on bike usage.

## Conclusion

The project provides valuable insights into user behavior and usage patterns for bike sharing services. It highlights the importance of factors such as weather conditions, seasonality, and commuting patterns in influencing user activity.

## Next Steps

Further analysis can focus on:

- Building predictive models to forecast bike usage.
- Investigating the influence of marketing campaigns on user activity.
- Conducting user surveys to understand their preferences and motivations.
